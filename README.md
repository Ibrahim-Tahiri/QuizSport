# 🏃‍♂️ QuizSport – Run & Learn!

**QuizSport** is an Android application built with **Kotlin** that combines **physical activity** and **mental challenge**. The app encourages users to stay active by running a set distance and rewards them with quiz questions based on the distance covered.

## 📱 Features

- 🚀 **Program Selection**: Users choose a running program with a specific distance (e.g., 3 km, 6 km, etc.).
- 📍 **GPS Tracking**: The app calculates the distance using the device's real-time GPS location.
- 🏃 **Distance-Based Quiz**: After running, users are presented with a quiz. The number of questions corresponds to the distance run (e.g., 6 km = 6 questions).
- 🧠 **Earn Points**: Points are awarded based on:
  - Distance completed
  - Correct answers in the quiz
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** *(coming soon)*: View your achievements and stats over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** (Android development)
- **Google Maps API**
- **XML layouts**
- **MVVM architecture**


## 🚧 How It Works

1. The user selects a program (e.g., "Run 5 km").
2. The app tracks the distance using GPS.
3. Once the target distance is reached, the user receives a quiz.
4. The quiz consists of the same number of questions as kilometers run.
5. Points are calculated and saved based on performance.
